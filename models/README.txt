AI vs Human Text Classifier
===============================

Description:
-------------
This project is a machine learning web application built with Streamlit that detects whether a given text is written by a human or generated by AI models. It supports three classification models:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost

Features:
---------
- Single text input prediction with confidence scores.
- Batch processing of multiple texts from .txt, .csv, .pdf, and .docx files.
- Model comparison to see prediction agreement and probability scores.
- Clean and preprocess text data with custom cleaning, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- TF-IDF vectorization integrated into the preprocessing pipeline.
- Downloadable prediction results for batch processing.

Setup Instructions:
-------------------
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Install dependencies:



3. Ensure you have pre-trained model files and the TF-IDF vectorizer saved in the 'models/' directory:
- tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
- svm_model.pkl
- decision_tree_model.pkl
- adaboost_model.pkl

4. Run the Streamlit app:


How It Works:
-------------
- Text inputs are cleaned (lowercased, punctuation removed, numbers and alphanumerics removed), stopwords removed, and lemmatized.
- The cleaned text is vectorized using a TF-IDF vectorizer.
- The selected ML model makes a prediction whether the text is human or AI generated.
- Batch files are supported for processing multiple texts at once.
- Model comparison shows side-by-side predictions and probabilities.

File Formats Supported for Batch Processing:
---------------------------------------------
- Plain text (.txt)
- CSV files (.csv) â€” text should be in the first column
- PDF files (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)

Notes:
------
- The TF-IDF vectorizer and models must be trained with consistent preprocessing steps.
- The Streamlit app expects the models and vectorizer to be stored in the 'models/' folder.
- Make sure the versions of Python and libraries match those used in training.
